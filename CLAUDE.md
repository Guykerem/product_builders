# Product Builders

This is a shared learning environment for product managers who are learning to build with AI-assisted coding tools.

## What's Here

- `context/` — Knowledge base: best practices, guides, and reference material for PM builders
- `learnings/` — Community learnings: notes created via the `/learn` skill, contributed by PMs
- `.claude/skills/` — Skills that help PMs learn and build

## How to Use

1. Clone this repo and open it in Cursor or Claude Code
2. Browse `context/` to get oriented
3. Use `/learn [topic]` to research anything — it saves structured notes to `learnings/`
4. Contribute your learnings back by pushing to the repo

## Conventions

- All content is markdown — simple, portable, readable
- No personal information in this repo — only shared knowledge and expertise
- Learnings use a structured format with frontmatter (topic, date, tags)
- Commit messages for learnings: `learn: <topic title>`
