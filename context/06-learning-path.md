# The 2-Week AI PM Builder Path

A progressive curriculum for product managers going from zero to building with AI. Each day is 30-60 minutes. By the end, you will have built something real.

---

## Week 1: Foundations

### Day 1 — Set Up Your Environment
You will install the tools and get your workspace ready so nothing blocks you later.

- **Time:** 30 min
- **Reference:** [Getting Started](./00-getting-started.md)
- **Do:** Install Cursor, clone this repo, open it, and verify Claude responds when you ask it a question in the editor.
- **Checkpoint:** You can type a question in Cursor's AI chat and get a response.

### Day 2 — Understand How AI Coding Works
You will read how AI-assisted development actually works and have your first real conversation with Claude about a product idea.

- **Time:** 45 min
- **Reference:** `context/01` — How AI Coding Works
- **Do:** Read the guide, then open Claude and describe a product problem you care about. See what it suggests.
- **Checkpoint:** You had a back-and-forth conversation with Claude about your project and learned something from it.

### Day 3 — Your First Build
You will follow a guided tutorial and build a working feedback form from scratch using AI.

- **Time:** 60 min
- **Reference:** [Your First Build](./02-your-first-build.md)
- **Do:** Follow the tutorial step by step. Let Claude write the code. Focus on understanding what it produces.
- **Checkpoint:** A working feedback form running locally in your browser.

### Day 4 — PM Workflows with AI
You will learn how AI fits into core PM work — writing PRDs, specs, and user stories — and try it yourself.

- **Time:** 45 min
- **Reference:** `context/03` — PM Workflows
- **Do:** Take a real feature idea and write a PRD with Claude's help. Compare it to how you would have written it alone.
- **Checkpoint:** A draft PRD for a feature you actually care about.

### Day 5 — Install Skills and Explore
You will install skill packages that extend what Claude can do and experiment with commands like `/learn`.

- **Time:** 45 min
- **Reference:** `context/04` — Skills and Extensions
- **Do:** Install the recommended skill packages. Try `/learn` on a topic relevant to your work. Browse what else is available.
- **Checkpoint:** At least two new skills installed and tested.

## Week 2: Building

### Day 6 — Prompting Mastery
You will study what separates good prompts from great ones and practice rewriting weak prompts into strong ones.

- **Time:** 45 min
- **Reference:** `context/05` — Prompting Patterns
- **Do:** Work through the before/after examples. Then take three real prompts from your week and rewrite them using the patterns.
- **Checkpoint:** Three rewritten prompts with noticeably better outputs.

### Day 7 — Build Something You Actually Need
You will pick a real problem from your work and build a solution — an internal tool, a prototype, a dashboard, anything useful.

- **Time:** 60 min
- **Reference:** All previous context files as needed
- **Do:** Define the problem in one sentence. Describe it to Claude. Build it iteratively, one piece at a time.
- **Checkpoint:** A working first version of something you will actually use.

### Day 8 — Iterate and Refine
You will take yesterday's build and make it better — add a feature, fix a rough edge, improve the design.

- **Time:** 60 min
- **Reference:** `context/05` for prompting; `context/02` for build patterns
- **Do:** Pick the single biggest improvement that would make your tool more useful. Ask Claude to help you implement it.
- **Checkpoint:** A v2 that is meaningfully better than v1.

### Day 9 — Share and Collaborate
You will push your work, look at what others have built, and try running a teammate's project.

- **Time:** 45 min
- **Reference:** Your team's shared repo or channel
- **Do:** Push your project. Review at least one other person's build. Try cloning and running it locally.
- **Checkpoint:** Your code is pushed, and you have given feedback on someone else's work.

### Day 10 — Reflect and Plan Next Steps
You will look back at what you built and learned, then decide what you want to tackle next.

- **Time:** 30 min
- **Reference:** Your own builds and notes from the past two weeks
- **Do:** Write a short reflection: What surprised you? What was harder or easier than expected? What do you want to build next?
- **Checkpoint:** A written reflection and a concrete next project idea.

## What Comes After Week 2

You now have the foundation. Here is how to keep going:

- **Keep building.** The single best way to get better is to build things you actually need. Every tool you make for yourself teaches you more than any tutorial.
- **Join communities.** Find other PMs who are building — internal Slack channels, the Cursor community, AI PM groups. Learning accelerates when you share.
- **Explore advanced tools.** Try MCP servers, custom skill packages, multi-file projects, and API integrations. Each one unlocks a new tier of what you can build.
- **Teach someone else.** The fastest way to solidify what you know is to walk someone else through their Day 1.

You are no longer a PM who asks engineering to build things. You are a PM who builds.
