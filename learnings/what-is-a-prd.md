# What is a PRD

A PRD (Product Requirements Document) is the document a product manager writes to define what a product (or feature) should do, who it's for, and why it matters. Think of it as the contract between the PM and the rest of the team -- it answers "what are we building and why?" without dictating "how do we build it?" That distinction is important: a PRD describes the problem, the users, the desired behavior, and success criteria, but leaves the technical architecture to engineering.

In practice, a PRD is what aligns everyone -- design, engineering, marketing, leadership -- around a shared understanding of the product before anyone starts building. Without one, teams end up building different things based on different assumptions, which leads to rework. Research from the Carnegie Mellon Software Engineering Institute found that 60-80% of software development cost goes to rework, and that solid requirements management can eliminate 50-80% of project defects. The PRD is your primary tool for getting requirements right.

A typical PRD includes: an overview (what and why), target personas (who), user scenarios and stories (how people will use it), success metrics (how we'll know it worked), a timeline, features in scope, features explicitly out of scope, designs or mockups, and open questions. The "features out" section is particularly valuable -- explicitly stating what you're *not* building prevents scope creep and misaligned expectations.

PRDs are living documents, not stone tablets. They start rough, often with "TBD" placeholders, and get refined as the team learns more. Modern teams tend toward two flavors: a lean one-pager for small features (problem, metrics, a few user stories, launch notes) and a full PRD for larger efforts that need cross-team coordination, detailed specs, and risk analysis.

## Key Takeaways

- A PRD defines *what* you're building and *why*, not *how* -- it's the PM's primary alignment tool for the team.
- The best PRDs include explicit "features out" sections that prevent scope creep by naming what you're deliberately not building.
- Treat it as a living document: start with what you know, mark unknowns as TBD, and update as the product evolves through its lifecycle.

## Try It

Write a one-pager PRD for something simple you wish existed -- maybe a browser extension, a Slack bot, or a feature in an app you use daily. Use this structure: **Problem** (2-3 sentences on what's broken), **Users** (who feels this pain), **Solution** (what the product does, described from the user's perspective), **Success metrics** (how you'd know it's working), **Features out** (one thing people might expect that you're deliberately not including). Keep the whole thing to one page. The act of writing "features out" is where the real product thinking happens.
